Name: Mario Yepez



Instructions:

There are a series of steps that need to be followed before a visual is rendered to the screen.

1) Stops must be selected from the Wheel Menu to the left of the Window, here you can toggle which
routes to be displayed. Tot will be the sum of all the bus lines data for the specified time.

2) The days to be rendered can be modified using the slider at the bottom of the window, which will let you pick the start date and end date.

3) On the top right there is a button labeled "Select Stops to Render" Clicking on it will allow the user to choose which bus stops to account for
in the visualization. A menu will pop up with a select form which will allow the user to choose the stops.

4) On the right panel there is a Time Range section which will allow the user to choose which time period for the day to render, if for example
if you wish to render the data from 7am to 12pm the user would select 07:00:00 as the start time and 12:00:00 for the end date

5) There is a toggle for "Days of the Week" which allows the user to filter out days of the week to render.

Once all options have been selected, hit "Update" to render the visualization to the screen. Hover over the bar to display more info such as the date and the number of people
